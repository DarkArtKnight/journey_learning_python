# My Python Learning Journey üêç

Welcome to my personal Python practice repository! This is my digital notebook and coding playground where I'm documenting my journey of learning Python.

## About This Repository

This space is a collection of my practice scripts, solutions to coding challenges, small projects, and random experiments. It's a "code dump" in the best way possible‚Äîa place for me to freely try new things, make mistakes, and see my skills grow over time.

The code here might not always be the most efficient or elegant, but every file represents a step forward in my learning process.

## What's Inside?

You'll find a mix of scripts covering topics like:

* **Core Concepts:** Working with data types, loops, functions, and classes.
* **Problem Solving:** Tackling exercises from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or other coding challenge websites.
* **Small Projects:** Simple applications to practice putting concepts together.
* **Automation Scripts:** Fun little scripts to automate daily tasks.

## Goals

My main goal is to build a solid foundation in Python and become a more confident programmer. I'm using this repository to keep myself accountable and to have a tangible record of my progress.

Thanks for stopping by!
